    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use EDA to determine what classifier model and with what features will be able to predict the winner of a League of Legends game with the best accuracy. The data used represents competitive League of Legends matches from 2015 to 2017 from the NALCS, EULCS, LMS, CBLoL, and LCK. We will apply logistic regression and random forest to predictor features of our choice from the dataset and evaluate the performance of the models. We will evaluate the performance of our model based on the accuracy of its classification of winners of the matches that is not from the training data. A visualization method will be used to help understand the results of our model in more detail.\n",
    "After analyzing the accuracy scores, we will be able to conclude which algorithm/model and feature is best for predicting the winner of a match. \n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "League of Legends, an online multiplayer game, has emerged as a significant area of interest for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts due to its complex and multifaceted gameplay. Two substantial contributions have been made to this field of research by Diego Angulo Quintana and Yingshan Li, who have both utilized diverse data and machine learning models to predict the outcome of the matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diego Angulo Quintana's study stands out in the sense that it focuses primarily on the objectives achieved by each team as predictive parameters<a name=\"quintana\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#quintananote). His methodology implies that the various objectives throughout the game, such as securing Dragon or Baron Nashor, have a decisive role in determining the outcome. Quintana's research offers crucial insights into the importance of in-game objectives, serving as an informative resource for those interested in identifying the key performance indicators in a League of Legends match.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Yingshan Li's research<a name=\"li\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#linote) tackles the issue from a different perspective by studying the early stage of the game. Li utilizes statistics from the first 10 minutes of ranked matches to predict match outcomes. This approach underlines the significance of early game performance in shaping the rest of the match, suggesting that strategies and actions in the initial phases can potentially affect the game's outcome. Furthermore, Li compares different machine learning models to assess their accuracy, contributing valuable information to the ongoing dialogue around the most suitable predictive algorithms for such complex tasks."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are trying to solve is the accurate prediction of the winner in League of Legends matches using data from competitive matches played between 2015 and 2017. The problem is well-defined and can be quantified, measured, and replicated.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is quantifiable because the prediction we will make with the logistic regression model is based on probability. It is also measureable through the dataset provided, as every match entails of the accurate objectie scores, champion ban or picks, and gold differences along the match is provided following a timeline. The gold difference column we will be using is a integer value, and we are able to conduct mathematical operations on it and obtain specific measurements for our data for every match. Moreover, the problem is replicable in that many League of Legends games can be played and analyzed to validate the accuracy of our prediction models.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The gold difference between teams (i.e., the difference in total gold earned by each team at any given point in the match) can often indicate which team is in the lead or has the upper hand. A significant gold difference can highlight a major discrepancy in team strengths, often translating into one team having better items and thus a higher likelihood of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature we chose to apply our prediction models on is the kda difference between the blue and red team for each match. This could be a good indicator for chance of winning in a match because the more a team snowballs to victory, the stronger their champions get against the champions in the other team, leading to higher chance of winning team fights, and therefore getting more kills than the other team who has a lower chance of winning. Given the nature of subtracting the number of red team's champion kills from the blue teams, we will suspect the kda ratio to be a positive integer rather than a negative, whenever the blue team has been labeled as the winner of the match. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third feature we would like to conduct prediction model learning is on the winrate difference of the champions between teams might indicate a team has stronger champions and thus an upper hand. An upper hand, could leave to a higher likelihood of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "After comparing the performance of the logistic regression model and the random forest classifier on each of the three features, we will be able to determine which feature has better metrics for predicting the winner of a league of legends game."

We will compare the performance of the logistic regression as a base model with the Random Forest classifier.

    "### Interpreting the result\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Point: \n",
    "\n",
    "Gold difference is the best feature at determining the winner of a League of Legends match.\n",
    "Across all models and all features, the two with the highest accuracy were the gold difference models. Gold difference via logistic regression yielded a very high accuracy of 0.9665354330708661.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub Point: \n",
    "\n",
    "There was no clear best model for all features. The difference in accuracies of the two models did not differ that much except for wrdiff where it differed by about 7%. However, logistic regression performed better for gold difference and wrdiff, while random forest was better for kda.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub Point: \n",
    "\n",
    "Preliminary results do not tell the whole story. When looking at the correlations, kda had the highest correlation, so one might have assumed that it would also have the highest accuracy. However, this is not true. The recall and precision seemed to be a better indicator of accuracy with gold diff having the highest precision and recall for the three features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was somewhat limited in that it required a lot of cleaning. Additionally, it did not track other potentially useful features like damage and damage share. Our question is quite open ended, and it would have been good to explore how the models worked with the features combined. I think this would have gave a definitive answer on what model was best for this task regardless of feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "There is privacy in that players who play these League of Legends matches from which the data is found may not consent to their data being given. While this could be considered an ethical issue, the players know the data is publicly available since the matches are broadcasted and no sensitive data is given out.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue could be that someone uses this data to gain the upper hand in the match by leveraging statistics. This could be considered an ethical issue since it might be an unfair advantage. Our team will address these issues by informing players of what data is being collected, how it might impact them, where to find it, and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The gold difference using a logistic regression model is the best at determining the winner of a League of Legends match. Our results support it through the high accuracy, recall, and precision of the gold difference with logistic regression model. This is further strengthened by the confusion matrix. Gold difference also had the best stats except for correlation than the other features. Finding which features and models are the best for a prediction are very important in machine learning and should be considered with every machine learning problem. Through improving feature and model selection, one can yield better predictions. In the future, combining the features to find a definitive best overall model would be ideal."
